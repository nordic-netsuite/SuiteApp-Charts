# SuiteApp-Charts
## Brand new chart types for NetSuite.
The SuiteApp provides your NetSuite account with a library of brand new chart types. Available charts include: Bar, Stacked Bar, Multiple Bar, Area, Line, Donut, Funnel, Gauge meters, Datagrid, Maps etc.

## Predefined charts
Alterview Charts includes predefined charts for each available chart type. The predefined charts provides KPIs for a variety of areas and are ready to be used as is. Alternatively, use the predefined configurations as inspiration when building your very own charts.

## Charts from Saved Searched
To configure a new chart, simply select a saved search from which the data should be collected. Of course, it is also possible to merge several saved searches into one chart!

## BI-center on your NetSuite Dashboard
Once the chart configuration is in place it is easy to publish your selected charts on the dashboard, simply by adding a custom content portlet.

All data that is searchable in NetSuite can now be visualized on your dashboards. Or why not configure your own BI-center within your NetSuite account.

## Native SuiteApp - Security
The solution only uses its own tables and files, and does not affect other NetSuite tables or configurations in the system. In other words, you can feel confident that the SuiteApp does not cause any problems in other parts of the system.
